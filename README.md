# A Unified Heat Transfer Coefficient for Phase Change Time Prediction Across Biot Number Regimes

This repository contains the code and data for the article *"A Unified Heat Transfer Coefficient for Phase Change Time Prediction Across Biot Number Regimes"* (Patino, 2026).

## Description

The article presents a unified analytical model to predict the phase change time in phase change materials (PCM) for an extended range of Biot numbers (0.01 ≤ Bi ≤ 2). The model is derived from a thermal resistance analysis and uses a global heat transfer coefficient U.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the analytical model, numerical solution, and visualization.
- `data/`: Data used in the article.
- `figures/`: Figures generated by the scripts.
- `supplementary_material/`: Supplementary material with derivations and analysis.
- `examples/`: Usage examples.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or use `environment.yml` for conda).

## Usage

Run the scripts in `examples/` to reproduce the main results.
